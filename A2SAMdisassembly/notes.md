##Apple ][ SAM program disassembly

These are the disassembly I created of the Apple 2 SAM programs. There are two programs, the SAM program that takes phonemes as input. and the RECITER that takes text as input.

I have added some comments to the listing. Enough to be able to work it into the A3 driver, so not sure I'll get much more done on this.

These are able to be assembled with the CA65 assembler.
